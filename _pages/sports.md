description: "I've been in love with sports ever since I can remember - it has taught me resilience and teamwork, showed me the taste of defeat and how to handle winning and losing with grace, and brought me an invaluable group of friends with similar competitive spirits. It has unconsciously become (and will always be) an indispensable part of my life."
